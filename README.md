# speedthru
A Firefox Extension that speeds thru ads so I can get back to my normal scheduled YouTube videos.

## Inspiration
I don't like ads (: 

## How it works

### **Disclaimer**
> Not sponsored by Moran Pober. Furthermore,
do not go to uni.acquisitions.com. Doing some research they run a pretty scammy setup where they make money screwing with their clients.

## To Use/Run
Simply Click on the firefox Extension

## Limitations
* Will not play audio because it will go 16 times speed of the original video. 
* Furthermore, **will also play videos at 16 times if clicked during a video.**
